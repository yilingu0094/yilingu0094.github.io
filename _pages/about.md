Welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD student at the [System Engineering and Engineering Management (Operations Research track)](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/research/operations-research/) program of [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), fortunately supervised by [Prof. Viet Anh Nguyen](https://www.vietanhnguyen.net/).

In recent years, I've been studying the application of machine learning and optimization theory in production and operations management. My current works fall into two main directions. Since many real-world objectives are defined in nonconvex-nonconcave minmax settings and the datasets provided are always of a large scale, solving [nonsmooth nonconvex-nonconcave minmax problem with stochastic algorithms](https://yilingu0094.github.io/research/) is the primary area that I've been studying at SRIBD. Additionally, <a href="https://yilingu0094.github.io/research/#2-adaptive-multiple-vector-quantization-classification-master-thesis">my master thesis</a> aims to develop a novel prototype-based classification algorithm that better capture the non-convex and sparse pattern of classes with improved interpretation, convergence, and simplicity.

I have obtained my master degree (with distinction) in Information Management and Business Analytics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) in Nov. 2023, fortunately supervised by [Prof. Andre Milzarek](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/64). Prior to that, I received my BSc in Business Analytics with the First Class Honors at the [Business School](https://www.must.edu.mo/en/msb) of [Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST)](https://www.must.edu.mo/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhao Honghao](https://www.must.edu.mo/images/MSB/files/ZhaoHongHao_SC.pdf).

Here is my personal CV: \[[Curriculum Vitae](https://yilingu0094.github.io/files/CV_Yilin Gu_updated.pdf)\] and part of my academic awards: \[[Certificate](https://cuhko365-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/221025012_link_cuhk_edu_cn/EdlJ0FbPdhxLm3cDzeERBVsByZgHSWGYQcTlQNPrI26srQ?e=QeDv0c)\].

You are always welcome to send me an email and schedule a conversation at any time. If you have any questions regarding my research or any fascinating subject related to operation research, optimization, or machine learning theory, please feel free to talk with me :)
